# Coop-seq experiments with CRX homeodomain and its variants
This directory contains all scripts and metadata information used to process and analyze Coop-seq data. All the intermediate and processed data generated are stored under the `processed_data` folder. The raw data can be downloaded from [GEO](link_to_coopseq_GEO).

## Brief description of scripts and metadata files
- `calculate_cooperativity.ipynb` takes in cpm normalized counts of the coop-seq library and calculates cooperativity index.
